# TTS_video
## Text-to-speech script and add it to an input video
Multi-Language and
Control Speech Speed

I use it to make commercial videos, I put the final video and run the script, you need to write or paste the text you want to speak then choose the voice's speed.

READ BEFORE: 
- I set the video to be looped until the end of the voice so it cannot be dark after the video ends and the voice goes.
- If the audio is shorter than the video, the video continues silently.
- The input video must be named "input_video".
- The script removes the original video's sound.

TUTORIAL:
- Make a new folder and put the script in it.
- Put the video in the same folder.
- Run the script and follow the instructions.
